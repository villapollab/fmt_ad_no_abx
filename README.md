# fmt_ad_no_abx
Code used to process 16S V1-V3 sequence data on the effects of FMT and TBI on Alzheimer's mice microbiomes.

There is a pretty extensive documentation for this microbiome analysis and can be found at this link [here](https://villapollab.github.io/fmt_ad_no_abx/).

The 16S data for this can be found at the BioProject [PRJNA1220689](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1220689).
